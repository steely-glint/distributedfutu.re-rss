And this episode is somewhat meta in that it's about podcasts and the rise of podcasts and where we think they might be going. Podcasts are kind of weird because they started a long time ago and then they sort of went quiet and now they're having a Renaissance and it's really interesting like how how many people talk about?<!--invalid font number 1-->

<font color="#000000">Oh, you know, &quot;I heard that on a podcast&quot; or like kind of. Reference the more like they really are something that people talk about and if they talk about them on buses, but like they do come up in conversation, which is kind of interesting because it's new I think <!--invalid font number 1-->

<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">I think it's easier to listen to a podcast on a commute than it is to pull out a book and I think that's true of like audio books as well. I think more we're using our devices to listen to more now than ever. [00:01:00] So not always something Visual and always something like a video or Netflix on your phone, but just having something to listen to you.<!--invalid font number 1-->

Like so she has a series of audio books that she listens to on commutes and you know driving around for work and then if they really good she'll get them into the house and listen to them like on the stereo at home, but they have to be like beyond the<!--invalid font number 1-->

<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">like listening to a podcast while I'm doing the ironing or things like that, but I just can't do it for me. It's a very like using the time that I have getting to places task. It's that's when I listen to podcasts. That's when I will try and do an audiobook other other circumstances just doesn't [00:02:00] work for me.<!--invalid font number 1-->

<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">That's interesting because I like I have I have a in Berlin. I have a podcast player a dedicated podcast player sitting on my kitchen table and I listen to it over breakfast and I listen to it in the evening when I'm cooking dinner and pretty much no other time in the day. <!--invalid font number 1-->

</font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">Whereas if I'm doing another task my brain wanders and I don't really listen, right? So that's where I'm like background music or just something playing on the TV not not something that I actually want to engage with. <!--invalid font number 1-->

</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">So the conversation is Vic is actually also about the kind of mechanics of podcasts and and you know, how. How they are made and what you need to do to make them not kind of in [00:03:00] huge amount of depth but like talking about them and and. And it made me super conscious of like the process of producing this podcast.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">Like I sort of evolved in a we've kind of got ourselves into a little bit of a habit about how it works but talking to Vic. I suddenly realized like, oh we do that or we don't do this and and and and I've got this kind of I know that when I actually put this one together, I'm going to feel really super challenged about whether I'm doing the editing right.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">Like, you know, is it going to be super polished like Vic would want it and I'm like actually and kind of go going to go the other way. I'm just going to throw it together and it's going to sound like a mess but I sort of I almost like that's an aesthetic in itself. It's a like, you know, this is you're hearing us.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">It's a sort of a more authentic feel to it than like than we do if I'd removed all the likes and the umms.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Vim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"> Yeah. Yeah, and I think so. There's a podcast that I started to listen to but the podcasters also [00:04:00] video record the interviews that they do. So the their main focus is actually people watching it on YouTube and the podcast is a subset of that and you can really tell when you're listening to it just as a podcast because the convent that they talk over each other and they argue and it's is quite comedic.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">And when you're listening to it is is a just a listener. It's quite frustrating because you can't it's not just a flowing conversation. But as I can imagine if you're watching it, it would be fine. It'll be like a comedy sketch and you can you can see their relationship with one another and I think that was really interesting for me to hear if like that the kind of spectrum of messiness versus cleanness or precision.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">Well, if you're trying to do too many mediums at once to do it doesn't work. <!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Right right. I mean I had I had that experience the podcast over and I'm listening to called Lingthusiasm and those are a couple of [00:05:00] interesting things about that. But one of them is that they did it recently they they did a patreon and they raise some money and they decided to video record an episode and they video recorded an episode of this thing thats about language.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">So you think it would make a perfect podcast but actually. Very interested in gestures and how you gesture when you're speaking and how they like how that ties into when you speak and actually really interesting podcast, but what was weird about it is of course, they gestured a lot and they just they demonstrated the gestures which works in video on YouTube but didn't work in audio so then started to try and describe the gestures and that really doesn't work, you know.<!--invalid font number 1-->

<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">so so kind of interesting what like has you say how the content. Is affected by the medium and how you how it how it works. I kind of and and Vic was saying one of the things that I took away from what Vic was saying is that you can then edit down little kind of sub [00:06:00] adverts of of content little nuggets of content, which I sort of like.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">I get but I sort of feel it is wrong. You watch it here the whole thing, you know, but yeah, it's interesting interesting set of challenges there about no know how people have people listen and you've got to try and get your head around what can what position they're in when they're listening what they're doing what their know, do you repeat what you say because they might have missed it or should you just assume that everyone's listening and focusing on what you're doing.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">And I've lost you. We've got this weird thing where you vanish. <!--invalid font number 1-->

<!--invalid font number 0-->

<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Right? Mmm or should have been fine. Anyway. Yeah, we're well, there you go. There's an edit I'll have to make but<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Vim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"> yeah, maybe if you keep it in just to prove.<!--invalid font number 1-->

</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">But what I was going to [00:07:00] say is the length of time the length of the length of a podcast has a big impact on me as well. So if it's too short I get frustrated listening to 3 or 4 all on my commute. Where is if it's too long? And I have to break it up over me over two commutes I get frustrated as well.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font><!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Yeah. Yeah that and so you've got to try and understand how you think that people are listening to it. I like kind of who again we took it took him to Vic about this there are certain kind of little info bursts that like five minutes of of news or tweet of the day or something like little little crispy things and then there's and then.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">More discursive thing and I think we're aiming for the more kind of more discursive side of it. <!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font><!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Vim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Yeah, and it also looked like what's the value that you get from those different lengths as well? <!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Yeah, I mean there's a whole thing about value in terms of like actually also about like that there's money and podcasts now [00:08:00] apparently serious money.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">No. No, I should emphasize that we're not like that's not why we're doing it. And in fact, there is no money and it costs me a small amount of money every month to do this very small amount of money every month, but. It's more in time actually, but like there are people who are making kind of businesses out of streams of podcasts and podcasting sites and tools and there's a whole Industries coming up and I think the well again, you kind of need to listen to the conversation with Vic.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">But I but it I think part of it is to do with how alienated we are from. The over-polished over produced media that use the glossy stuff you see on TV <!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Vim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"> so I find it really interesting how podcast go viral now in the same way that other media does so Serial for example. Was one that kind of really took off and everyone was talking about it at one point and [00:09:00] it's that thing of it has become this new form of media and entertainment that we just didn't have before but then my question actually is it any different to albums and music and just listening to two things.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Yeah, is it different from albums? I think yes that one of the things again we talked about Vic was this this the cycle that it's every couple of weeks or it's every week or you know in some of the short ones it's every day that that cycle that repetitiveness means that it's it's more like. Radio in that sense that it's a show you listen to the content may be more kind of like listening to to an album.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">They know kind of 45 minutes, whatever but <!--invalid font number 1-->

<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Tim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">But that regularity and the expectation that it will be out at this point. It's different somehow and then the fact that you know that it'll be there for your [00:10:00] commute might for example. <!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
<!--invalid font number 0-->
<b><font color="#000000">Vim: <!--invalid font number 2-->
</font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Yeah, but also the relationships you build with the people that you're listening to so you start to build this kind of oh, I know what they're kind of position on different things are and I know that.<!--invalid font number 1-->
<font color="#000000"><br>
</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">They'll either challenge or agree with some of the things I'm saying. Well, I respect their opinion on different things. I think that's really interesting too. There are certain podcast podcast as well. And I I totally know them and it's actually no I really don't<!--invalid font number 1-->

I'm getting older and I do forget people's faces, but right really it's like who the hell are you?

What I'm doing, I am not doing anything<!--invalid font number 1-->

<font color="#000000">right. Right now, I'm holding a snowball microphone with no no pop filter on it next to a window. I'm doing things all wrong. I think how you use it is is equally as important as getting a good microphone because at the end of the day you do get you do get [00:13:00] what you pay for, but you can make.

<font color="#000000">High price methods with little impact. So for example finding paper newsletters out to hundreds of people at 70% support and whereby a podcast could be a better use of resources to tell their stories. So the low-cost thing is massive because obviously, you know, a lot of Charities and social Enterprises don't have bucket loads of money number two, is that what podcasting is such a personable <font color="#a3a3a3">()<font color="#000000"> person can't say this <font color="#a3a3a3">()<font color="#000000"> [00:16:00] personal medium that can convey and conjure up<!--invalid font number 1-->

Not like as a film producer, you wouldn't release all the good bits of a trailer and these audiograms are like trailers they are the hooks to get you wanting to listen to more see wouldn't put the conclusion of a story on on an audiogram and wouldn't you know where you want to put the punchline to a joke on an audiogram?<!--invalid font number 1-->

We'll move onto this in about actually how about this time and they don't know where to find them but asking people who do listen to podcasts where they listen to them.<!--invalid font number 1-->

<font color="#000000">So it's interested in psychology of listening habits. And when people listen to certain things, I think learning as well a friend of mine were talking about it yesterday about the learning element of podcasts and how how we listen to a lot of things to learn something new, but listen to stuff that we would have never listen to me before so, you know, the bird watching podcast would never ever be interested in picking up a bird-watching book or watching a program about bird-watching but because it's in podcast form, I find it easier to maybe digest or switch off <!--invalid font number 1-->

</font></font></font><!--invalid font number 2-->
<font color="#000000">is the music and if you're used to listening to a savior used to listen to a BBC Radio 1 or a BBC 6 music then that the comparison that it's just like radio is a bit is a is not that relevant.

<font color="#000000">Another difference is the professionalism. I think we are so used to listening to.
